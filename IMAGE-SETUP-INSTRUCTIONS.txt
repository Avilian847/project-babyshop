============================================

📁 FOLDER STRUCTURE
-------------------
Create this folder structure where your HTML file is:

your-website/
├── AVILIAN.html
├── Avilian.css
├── Avilian.js
└── images/
    ├── logo.png (or logo.jpg)
    └── gallery/
        ├── image1.jpg

        ├── image8.jpg
        └── image9.jpg


🖼️ HOW TO ADD YOUR IMAGES
--------------------------

STEP 1: Create the folders
---------------------------
1. In the same folder as your HTML file, create a folder called "images"
2. Inside "images", create a folder called "gallery"


STEP 2: Add your logo
----------------------
1. Put your logo file in the "images" folder
2. Rename it to "logo.png" (or keep the name and update the CSS)
3. If your logo has a different name, update line 145 & 156 in Avilian.css:
   
   Change: background-image: url('images/logo.png');
   To: background-image: url('images/YOUR-LOGO-NAME.png');


STEP 3: Add your gallery images
--------------------------------
1. Put your 9 product images in the "images/gallery" folder
2. Rename them: image1.jpg, image2.jpg, image3.jpg, ... image9.jpg
   
   OR
   
   Keep your original filenames and update the HTML (lines 139-173):
   
   Change: <img src="images/gallery/image1.jpg" alt="Baby product 1">
   To: <img src="images/gallery/YOUR-IMAGE-NAME.jpg" alt="Baby product 1">


📝 TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS
-------------------------
✓ Use JPG format for photos (smaller file size)
✓ Use PNG format for logo (better quality with transparency)
✓ Optimize images before uploading (compress them to load faster)
✓ Recommended image sizes:
  - Logo: 500x500 pixels or similar square
  - Gallery images: 800x800 pixels (will be cropped to square)


🔧 WHAT I FIXED
---------------
✅ Gallery now displays real images (not placeholders)
✅ Logo appears as faded background behind hero text
✅ Fixed floating action button (FAB) - now works properly
✅ Fixed all broken links (TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp)
✅ Fixed HTML structure (closed all tags properly)
✅ Fixed email link in footer
✅ Made gallery responsive for mobile
✅ Added smooth scrolling
✅ Improved hover effects on gallery items


🎨 CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
-------------------------
If you want to adjust the logo:

1. Make it MORE visible in background:
   - In Avilian.css line 156, change: opacity: 0.08;
   - To a higher number like: opacity: 0.15;

2. Make it BIGGER/SMALLER:
   - In Avilian.css line 145, change: background-size: 400px;
   - To your preferred size

3. Use ONLY the faded watermark style:
   - In Avilian.css line 145, remove or comment out the background-image
   - Keep only the ::before section (lines 149-159)


📱 RESPONSIVE DESIGN
--------------------
✓ Works on phones, tablets, and desktops
✓ Gallery adjusts automatically
✓ Mobile menu works perfectly
✓ FAB button sized appropriately for touch


❓ NEED HELP?

If images don't show:
